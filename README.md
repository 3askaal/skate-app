This is an unfinished project

Why I decided to stop working on this project:
- Skateboarding is not that much about competition
- It has no business model
- I was done learning new things in this project


## Concept
Games of skate are games skateboarders play at the skatepark.

Rules:
You start off with rock, paper, scissors for the order. The first player starts by doing a trick, when he doesn't land it the next player has to try a trick. If a trick is landed the opponent has 1 try to do the same trick properly. If he lands it, the game continues. If he doesn't land it, the opponent gets a letter. The first one who has S.K.A.T.E loses.

This app allows you to:
- make an account
- make friends
- register these games with your friends
- host tournaments with up to 32 people
- get reports of your played games with some statistics
- rank up in the leaderboards
